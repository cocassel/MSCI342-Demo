# MSCI342_Demo

To run this app all you need to do is run the Python file. But first let's set up your environment...

Donwload Python if you don't already have it (any version should work but 2.7 is the best). Also download PyCharm - it is hands down the best editor for Python.

Open up PyCharm and create a new project. Then add the Python script from this repo to your project. Go to PyCharm preferences and a window will pop up. Go the "Project Interpreter" tab. You should see a drop down for "Project Inerpreter". Make sure this is not blank! This is how PyCharm will run your project. 

Now, in the same "Project Interpreter" tab, look for a plus sign button. Click it and search for "Flask". Then select the "Flask" module and click "Install Package". 

At this point, you should be good to go. Click the run button (looks like a play button) in PyCharm and your app should run! It'll print out the URL you need to visit to see your app running (it will be running on your local machine). Click on the URL and it'll take you to the "/" route of your flask app. Change the route to "/test" and you will see the page change. Then change the route to "/demo" and you will see page change once more.
